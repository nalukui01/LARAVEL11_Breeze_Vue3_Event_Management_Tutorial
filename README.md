This was a tutorial on creating an event management application that takes in a date, place, time to begin and time to end using laravel 11 ,breeze and vue 3. It implements CRUD features. 
I modified the navigation on the main page and corrected some of the issues in the code from the tutorial. 
I am now looking into laravel-vue-pagination documentation to see how I can implement pagination.
